<br>

Welcome to my repository dedicated to explain the construction of a Trading Plartform!

<br>

<h2 align="center">üåÖ Journey Highlights üåÖ</h2>
<p>
Building the trading was a logique choice for me. I knew that I needed challenged on building, maintening   a dynamic database. Having previously developed a trading AI with TensorFlow (link to the project), the logical next step was to create an entire trading environment based on a custom database. As of now, the database consisting of five different tables, one of which has over 35 million rows.

<h1></h1>

<h3>Quick platform review </h3>

The platform boasts 8 distinct trading strategies (4 for buying and 4 for shorting) applicable to over 11,000 different stocks, cryptocurrencies, and other assets. The list of tickers is updated daily, automated data download providing real-time updates on the website. Additionally, the website offers a TradingView chart.

*The code is complete, and the website functions locally. However, I acknowledge that the HTML code for the user interface does not meet the standards of a well-finished website. Despite website development not being my primary focus, I am committed to delivering quality work. I will share the link to the website as soon as I complete the necessary improvements. Thank you for your understanding*

<h3>Trading Strategies Efficiency</h3>
The trading strategies underwent two testing phases on paper trading (no real money). Initially, a 24-day evaluation (October 3rd to 27th) focused solely on the opening range strategies, resulting in a nominal loss of 1.5%. 

Following iterative adjustments and the incorporation of new trading strategies, a subsequent 20-day test spanning from October 27th to November 16th yielded a notable **7.6% profit over 20days**. 

However, it's crucial to note that these strategies are yet to undergo evaluation over an extended period to comprehensively assess their long-term efficiency and robustness.

To initiate the database creation process, first, generate the database named "app.db" using SQLite3. Execute the command "sqlite3 app.db" in the terminal to establish the initial database file. This step lays the foundation for subsequent configurations.

Following the database creation, proceed to set up a configuration file named "config.py." Enter essential Alpaca API credentials (API_KEY, SECRET_KEY, BASE_URL), define the file location for "app.db" (DB_FILE), and provide email configuration details (EMAIL_ADDRESS, EMAIL_PASSWORD, EMAIL_HOST, EMAIL_PORT).

Utilize the scripts in this repository to manage the database. Begin with the "create_db" script  <a href=""> Code Link</a> to establish the five necessary tables. You also have drop_db <a href=""> Code Link</a> to drop all tables in app.db.

Execute the "populate_stocks.py" script <a href=""> Code Link</a> to populate the "stock" table with information for every stock, cryptocurrency, and asset available on Alpaca. The data includes the symbol/ticker, name, exchange, and a flag indicating whether shorting is permissible. Ensure that the data is successfully loaded using DB Browser for SQLite (or other), resulting in over 13,000 rows. To automatically add new stocks if there is any, create a Crontab code to run the script. I personally run it daily, after market closure.

<h4>Fetching Historical Stock Prices:</h4>
The "populate_prices" script <a href=""> Code Link</a>. downloads data for all tickers in the "stock" table in the "stock_price" table, a process that may take some time due to the substantial volume of data.  Since some Alpaca functionalities are restricted or no longer free, Yahoo Finance is used as an alternative for obtaining free, extensive historical data.The script also addresses variations in ticker names, ensuring a match with Yahoo Finance or dropping unmatched tickers in "stock". After completion, the "stock" table is populated with over 11,000 tickers, the "stock_price" table featuring daily open, close, high, low, volume, and date information. Additionally, in "stock_price" the script calculates the Simple Moving Average (SMA) for 20 and 50 days and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for 14 days using the Ta-lib analysis library.

#######populate prices
This code is a Python script that connects to an SQLite database and updates stock price information, including technical indicators, by fetching data from Yahoo Finance. The primary steps are as follows:

Database Connection Setup:
Establish a connection to an SQLite database specified in the "config.py" file, and configure the database cursor.
Retrieve Stock Symbols from the Database:
Fetch stock symbols and related information from the 'stock' table in the SQLite database.
Define Date Range and Initialize Sets:
Define the end date for the data retrieval and create sets to keep track of processed symbols and those found in Yahoo Finance.
Iterate Through Symbols:
Loop through the stock symbols obtained from the database, replacing characters in the symbol name for compatibility with Yahoo Finance's API.
Check and Download Data from Yahoo Finance:
Check if the symbol has already been processed and, if not, attempt to download historical price data from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library. The script handles cases where the 'max' period is not allowed by downloading data for a single day.
Handle Data and Update Database:
Process the downloaded data, calculate technical indicators such as Simple Moving Averages (SMA) and Relative Strength Index (RSI), and insert the data into the 'stock_price' table of the SQLite database.
Clean Up and Remove Symbols:
Close the database connection and remove symbols not found in Yahoo Finance from the 'stock' table in the SQLite database.
Reason for Using Yahoo Finance Over Alpaca API:

The code explains that the choice to retrieve data from Yahoo Finance instead of Alpaca API is due to changes in Alpaca's free data retrieval policy, making it no longer viable to obtain extensive data for free. This shift to Yahoo Finance simplifies the data retrieval process and aligns with the script's goal of updating stock price information.
Symbol Formatting Differences:

The script highlights the need to replace certain characters in the stock symbols for compatibility between Alpaca and Yahoo Finance. This substitution ensures that symbols, when used as part of URLs or filenames, conform to the requirements of the respective APIs. Specifically, slashes ('/') and periods ('.') in the symbols are replaced with hyphens ('-'). This step facilitates a seamless transition between the different symbol formats used by Alpaca and Yahoo Finance.

#Opening range breakdown
Summary:

The goal of this script is to automate the identification and execution of trading strategies, specifically targeting opening range breakouts, for a set of stocks. It utilizes historical minute-level data obtained from Yahoo Finance and interacts with the Alpaca API to place buy orders when certain conditions are met.

Key Components and Steps:

Database Connection:
Connects to an SQLite database containing information about stocks, strategies, and related data.
Retrieve Strategy and Stock Information:
Retrieves the ID of the 'opening_range_breakout' strategy and gathers symbols associated with this strategy from the database.
Alpaca API Connection:
Establishes a connection to the Alpaca API using the provided credentials.
Define Time Range:
Defines the historical data range, typically the last 30 days, and sets the current date.
Check Existing Orders:
Fetches existing orders from Alpaca API after the current date to avoid redundant orders.
Loop Through Symbols:
Iterates through each stock symbol associated with the strategy.
Download Historical Data:
Downloads minute-level historical data from Yahoo Finance for each stock.
Calculate Opening Range:
Calculates the opening range (high - low) for the first 15 minutes of the market open.
Identify Breakout:
Identifies bars that close above the opening range high after the initial 15 minutes, signaling a potential breakout.
Place Alpaca Orders:
If a breakout is identified and there is no existing order for the symbol, a buy order is placed on Alpaca.
The order is set as a limit order with a take-profit order and a stop-loss order, creating a bracket order.
Print and Store Messages:
Prints and stores messages about the placed orders, providing information on the stock, limit price, and breakout details.
Summary Output:
Prints the final set of messages containing information about the executed orders.
Purpose and Significance:

The script automates the process of identifying opening range breakout opportunities, reducing manual effort and potential errors.
Historical data from Yahoo Finance is used due to the constraints on retrieving large datasets from the Alpaca API.
The Alpaca API is employed to execute trading orders based on the identified breakout conditions, facilitating an automated trading strategy.
Note:

The script incorporates modular functions from external files (helpers.py) for improved organization and readability.
The overall goal is to enhance the efficiency of executing a specific trading strategy by leveraging historical data analysis and algorithmic trading through the Alpaca platform.

#breakout
This code is used to submit a buy order with a trailing stop, ensuring that the stop price adjusts dynamically based on the stock's price movement. The bracket order setup further includes a limit price, which helps control the maximum price paid for the stock.

#Main
This FastAPI application, run through Uvicorn, is a web-based stock analysis and trading platform. It utilizes SQLite for local data storage, Alpaca API for real-time stock data, and FastAPI for building the web interface. The application offers functionalities such as filtering stocks based on various criteria (e.g., new closing highs/lows, RSI overbought/oversold, above/below SMA), viewing detailed stock information, applying trading strategies, and monitoring orders. The routes handle HTTP requests, connect to the SQLite database to execute queries, and render HTML templates using Jinja2. Overall, the objective is to provide a user-friendly platform for stock analysis, strategy application, and order monitoring.




#populate minute bars
This Python script performs the following operations:

Import Libraries:
Imports necessary libraries including configuration parameters, date handling, SQLite for database operations, Yahoo Finance API for stock data, Pandas for data manipulation, and CSV for reading a CSV file.
Get Date Range:
Retrieves the current date and sets a start date 29 days before that. This date range is used for fetching historical stock data.
Connect to SQLite Database:
Establishes a connection to the SQLite database using parameters from the configuration file.
Read Stock Symbols from CSV:
Reads stock symbols from a CSV file named 'minute_stocks.csv' and stores them in a list. Initializes an empty dictionary to store stock IDs.
Fetch Stock Information from Database:
Retrieves stock information, including Yahoo Finance symbols and IDs, from the database. Stores this information in a dictionary for easy access.
Fetch Historical Data for Each Stock:
For each stock symbol, fetches minute bars for a specified date range, resamples the data to 1-minute intervals, and inserts it into the 'stock_price_minute' table in the database.
Commit and Close Database Connection:
Commits the changes to the database and closes the connection.
In summary, this script automates the process of fetching minute-level historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance for a list of stocks, resampling the data, and storing it in an SQLite database.
